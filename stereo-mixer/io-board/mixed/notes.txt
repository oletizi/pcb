Notes on combination milling/drilling/engraving

o Milling alignment holes and engraving on the back side first is
  best. The THT holes should be the last operation, since the engraver
  can get diverted by the holes. Also, if using an oil layer, the oil
  won't drain through the holes.
  
o Top-left alignment hole is:
  Hole 2
     X: 0.9449 in
     Y: 4.1319 in

     X: 24 mm
     Y: 104.950
  Use this to reset zero if there's a crash or something. It's an
  eyeball job, but it's surprisingly effective. Registration seems
  within the tolerance of the machine.
  
o Engraving speed: 200 mm/min to avoid chatter
o Engraving depth: -0.15 mm (at least) w/ autoleveling to avoid gaps
o The autoleveler in bcnc goes NUTS when you test the margin the first
  time for some reason. Being outside the margin before testing might
  help. But, you have to be prepared to stop the damned thing or it
  will race off the end of the work area.
o The 

o 1 mm drill for THT holes
o 1 mm mill for alignment holes

o pcb/bin/alignment-holes.sh for generating the helical cut path, but
  need to tune the excellon file to make sure the hole diamater is set
  right.

o A layer of oil or W40 on the top of the pcb keeps dust down and
  seems to keep the tool a little happier.

o Double-sided tape sucks. Much better to use clamps and alignment pins.
